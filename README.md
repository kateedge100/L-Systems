# L-Systems
PPP Assignment 2

I have used LSystems to create 3d tree like structures out of gluCylinders from rules inputed by the user. To change rule first enter an axiom in the axiom.txt file (eg X) then in the Rule.txt file add that you want X to be replaced by at each iteration. Similarly you can also add another letter that will be replaced in the alphabet file and what it will be replaced by in the alphabetRule file. Despite it working originally there is a bug in which if you change the file contents within qycreator it will not update the actual file and hence will have no effect on the final result so files must be edited my opening the files outside qt and saving after changes are made. You can also pick between 2 tree types by clicking 1 and 2 on the keyboard and editing the number of iteration in order to make it grow or shrink using the left and right arrows.
