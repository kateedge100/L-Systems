PPP Assignment 2

I have used LSystems to create 3d tree like structures out of gluCylinders from rules inputed by the user. To change the rule first enter an axiom in the Axiom.txt file (eg X) then in the Rule.txt file add that you want X to be replaced by at each iteration(eg FX). Similarly you can also add another letter that will be replaced in the Alphabet file and what it will be replaced by in the AlphabetRule file. Despite it working originally there is a bug in which if you change the file contents within qtcreator it will not update the actual file and hence will have no effect on the final result so files must be edited my opening the files from within the directory and saving after changes are made. 

You can also pick between 2 tree types by clicking 1 and 2 on the keyboard. Furthermore you can edit the number of number of iterations it will grow which will change the height and complexity it is drawn to by using the left and right arrows to increase and decrease it, it will also restart the growing sequence each time it is changed. Finally the angle each branch is rotated by can be increased and decreased using the up and down arrows.
